# 🔍 Unsupervised Learning

Unsupervised learning deals with data that has no labels. The goal is to find patterns or structures in the data.

## How it Works
- The algorithm tries to group or organize the data on its own

## Examples
- Customer segmentation
- Market basket analysis
- Anomaly detection

## Common Algorithms
- k-Means Clustering
- Hierarchical Clustering
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
- Autoencoders
