# ðŸ§  Supervised Learning

Supervised learning is a type of machine learning where the model is trained using labeled data.

## How it Works
- Input data comes with corresponding labels
- The model learns to map input to output
- After training, it can predict labels for new data

## Examples
- Email spam detection (Spam / Not Spam)
- House price prediction
- Handwritten digit recognition

## Common Algorithms
- Linear Regression
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Trees
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)
