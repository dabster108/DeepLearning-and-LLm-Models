# ðŸ§  Deep Learning

Deep learning is a subfield of machine learning that uses neural networks with many layers to model complex patterns in data.

## How it Works
- Inspired by the structure of the human brain (neurons)
- Uses multiple layers of interconnected nodes

## Key Concepts
- **Neural Networks**
- **Activation Functions**
- **Backpropagation**
- **Convolutional Layers (CNNs)** â€“ For image data
- **Recurrent Layers (RNNs)** â€“ For sequence data

## Applications
- Image recognition
- Speech recognition
- Natural language processing
